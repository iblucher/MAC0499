Version 1.5.6
-------------

* Bugs [PIPE-8083, PIPE-8086, PIPE-8094]. Fixed link dependency problems.

Version 1.5.5
-------------

* Bug [PIPE-8040]. Fixed access to GDAS profile of Calar alto (long=-2.5,lat=+37.2).
* Update the Paramal GDAS file included with the Molecfit distribution 
  (gdas_profiles_C-70.4-24.6.tar.gz)

Version 1.5.4
-------------

* Bug / improvement [PIPE-7950]. GDAS profile access in parallel.

Version 1.5.3
-------------

* Bug fixed [PIPE-7917]
* Bug fixed [PIPE-7873]

Version 1.5.1
-------------

 * Various bug fixes.

Version 1.5.0
-------------

 * API adapted to the requirements of the ESO pipelines group
 * Modified the folder structure.
 * MOLECFITDIR and MOLECFITDIR_DATA environment variable paths can be used 
   at runtime. It's necessary for the pipelines in Jenkins regression tests.
 * Various bug fixes in the GUI.


Version 1.4.0
-------------

 * <basedir> was removed from the parameter file.
 * Paths are relative to the current directory.  Of course, it is still possible
   to give absolute paths.
 * Major upgrade of dependencies: LNFL v3.1, LBLRTM v12.8 and aer v3.6.
 * Molecfit no longer writes in installation directory and can therefore be
   installed systemwide now.
 * Calctrans is now also split in two: calctrans_lblrtm for the radiative
   transfer computation, and calctrans_convolution for convolving the spectra.
 * New examples.
 * Various minor bug fixes.

Version 1.2.0
-------------

 * Molecfit now uses the 3-hour interval gdas data files in the local database.
   Previously it only used the 6-hour interval files despite the finer
   granularity being available for Paranal.
   This means the interpolation of pressure and humidity values to the
   observation time should be more accurate.
 * When no gdas data is available in local database for the requested
   observation it will check an ESO server for a new version of the database.
   Currently the database on the server only contains the data for Paranal.
 * Disable automatic download of gdas data via grib as the server is not
   available anymore.
 * Fix possible crash when no gdas data is available and the averaged profile
   has to be used.
 * Updated bundled gdas data to include data up to 21.02.2016

Version 1.1.1
-------------

 * support ESO science data products standard (SDP) format for 
   one-dimensional (1D) spectra
   Note the use of units stored in this format is not yet supported,
   wlgtomicron still needs to be set correctly in the parameter file.
 * support astropy.io.fits in addition to pyfits for GUI
 * some more wxWidgets 3.0 fixes
 * updated bundled gdas data to include data up to 07.08.2015

Version 1.1.0
-------------

 * Improved convolution with a wavelength-dependent synthetic kernel, which
   does not produce weak periodic glitches anymore.
 * User-defined kernels can also be provided for each pixel separately. The
   required matrix of kernel elements has to be written into an ASCII file.
 * Removed input wavelength range limit. This allows usage with instrument
   data covering larger ranges.
 * improved compatibility with wxWidgets 3.0
 * updated bundled gdas data to include data up to 07.04.2015

Version 1.0.2
-------------

 * avoid pseudo-line at 2.069 Âµm in calctrans results of X-Shooter NIR-arm
   spectra due to an additional overlap of adjacent LBLRTM spectra. Only
   relevant for wide wavelength ranges, where LBLRTM has to be run several
   times.
 * improved robustness to invalid parameter inputs
 * updated bundled gdas data to include data up to 31.07.2014

Version 1.0.1
-------------

 * Fix wrong path for excluded pixels in crires example configuration.
 * Work around bugs in matplotlib 1.1.0 and 1.2.0 causing the mask tool
   selections to not work.

Version 1.0.0
-------------

 * First public release
